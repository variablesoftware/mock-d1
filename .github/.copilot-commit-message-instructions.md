# Commit Messages

Explain what all has changed.
We love emojis 🚂🎛️🧶⏮️📦😂😎
We use emojis in commit messages to make them more expressive and engaging. Here’s how we use them:
    x=major, y=minor, z=patch

examples:
    🌟 FEAT: We want a good release. x.Y.z ...
or
    🐛 FIX: We fixed a bug in the code. x.y.Z ...
or
    🧹 CHORE: We cleaned up the codebase. x.y.z ...
or
    🚨 BREAKING CHANGE: We made a change that breaks backward compatibility. X.y.z ...

We use semantic-release syntax for messaging.

- chore: (for changes that do not modify the public API, will not trigger a release)
- fix: (for bug fixes, triggers a patch release)
- feat: (for new features, triggers a minor release)
- BREAKING CHANGE: (in the body or footer, triggers a major release)
